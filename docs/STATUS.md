# Status — 2026-10-08

## Scope

1. Recover and visually verify one Endfield turret and its texture dependencies.
2. Recover and visually verify a player mech and an enemy from Destroy Gunners Sigma 1.10.
3. Implement persistent placement, boarding/dismounting, driving and firing, enemy combat, turret hostility/visibility checks.
4. Build a complete .scmod and verify it in an isolated Survivalcraft API 1.9.3.1 runtime.

## Evidence at initialization

- Endfield installed at E:/game/Hypergryph Launcher/games/Endfield Game; 65,296,522,560 bytes at inventory time.
- Destroy Gunners original APK SHA-256: d9ce01e477f22e5c96728ac879ae6200198e2a4b3141abbebf625a868fd8b8b0.
- Its BIN containers have 287 data, 456 graphics, 10 music and 32 sound entries; container decoding succeeded in the previous read-only audit.
- Scene assembly, model conversion and in-game behavior are not yet verified.

## Acceptance

- Deployed mech survives save/reload and stays after dismounting.
- Player boards, drives and fires, then exits into a safe free position.
- Ground turret tracks and damages a visible hostile enemy; does not fire through walls or at neutral/friendly units.
- Enemy moves, attacks, takes damage and dies.
- All three use validated recovered models; asset provenance and adapted versus recovered motions are documented.
